    "The coenzymes are metabolites that are re-newed after use. The transformed co-enzyme is converted back to the original through another reaction. This definition informs about the promiscous nature of coenzymes: they are used in many reactions. Using this particularity, BOFdat finds the coenzymes in the metabolic network by identifying the number of reactions in which the each metabolite participates and selecting the most promiscous. Metabolites excluded *a priori* include those that were added in BOFdat step1 (ATP, ADP, Pi,PPi, H+, H2O).\n",

    "Few experimental approaches can determine the inorganic ion composition of a cell. Hence, BOFdat defaults to a biased approach based on current knowledge to define the ionic composition of the cell. *Xavier et. al.*(2017) have studied the biomass composition of 72 published models available in the BiGG database at the time of publication. Their list of universal components is a valuable resource for the modelling community. BOFdat uses the list of inorganic ions identified in this study and compares them with the list of metabolites of the submitted reconstruction.\n",
